## Project: Weather App

A weather app created using React.js exploring the usage and implementation of APIs, ASYNC js, and useEffect() and other hooks. The project is inspired by The Odin Project curriculum.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Search city for current weather information and 5 day forecast
- View date, time, weather, temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and 'feels like' temp. at specified location
- See high/low and icon of weather information for 6 days

## Todos

- dynamic search bar in React (show options when searching)
- Make UI more responsive for phone screens

## What I learned

- VERY limited by API (free access information only)
- React: useEffect and other hooks
  => https://blog.logrocket.com/modern-api-data-fetching-methods-react/
- ES7 & Async JS (try/catch, Promise/then, async/await)
- working with APIs (API keys, endpoints, error handling)
- css media queries
  --> NEED TO ORGANIZE CSS BETTER!!

## Tools

- OpenWeather API
- React & ES7 JS
- ESLint + Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Prettier Code Formatter
